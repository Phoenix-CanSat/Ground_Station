For the fifth consecutive time we are participating in the Panhellenic competition "[CanSat in Greece](https://cansat.gr/)", a qualifier of the Pan-European competition "[CanSats in Europe](http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/CanSat/SEMXTDCKP6G_0.html)", organized by ESA (European Space Agency) for the last 8 years.
