# Phoenix Ground Station

## Who are we?
We are a team composed of 8 students of the [Model High School “Evangeliki Scholi Smyrna”](http://lyk-evsch-n-smyrn.att.sch.gr/wordpress/?p=1322). For the fifth consecutive time we are participating in the Panhellenic competition "[CanSat in Greece](https://cansat.gr/)", a qualifier of the Pan-European competition "[CanSats in Europe](http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/CanSat/SEMXTDCKP6G_0.html)", organized by ESA (European Space Agency) for the last 8 years. Our team is called Phoenix and our supervisor is Dr. Christos Fanidis.
